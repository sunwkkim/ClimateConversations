> Dr. Zhang will present the effects of climate change on evapotranspiration (ET) in Australia, focusing on actual and potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET). Using high-resolution climate models, ET changes from 1980 to 2100 were assessed under three emission scenarios. Findings reveal that AET generally decreases except for a minor increase under the highest emissions, with PET increasing across all scenarios. The accuracy of model-derived AET was validated against observational data. Precipitation and solar radiation are key factors influencing AET in Australia's changing climate. In contrast, changes in PET are influenced by solar radiation and maximum temperature.

> The Queensland Future Climate Web Services have been designed to act as an essential resource for stakeholders to access data and information on plausible future climates across the state. Data on the web services are derived from dynamically downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and support stakeholders with climate risk assessments, adaptation planning and policy development using a variety of tools suited to meet different user needs. The recent enhancement of the web services includes the integration of the latest CMIP6 data into all the web services' tools. This addition underscores the state government's commitment to offering the latest information to stakeholders. In this talk, Dr. McGloin will outline the state government's objectives in providing these web services and their importance in state-wide climate initiatives. Dr. McGloin will also showcase features of the dashboard and demonstrate how the information on the dashboard can be leveraged.

> Understanding the intricate details of climate patterns is crucial for making informed decisions in climate change adaptation. Despite the remarkable advancements made in climate modelling over the years, persistent biases in model outputs continue to pose challenges, hampering both scientific understanding and the decision-making processes for stakeholders. This talk will focus on a critical examination of Australia's climate modelling simulations, particularly aimed at understanding the drivers of nation-wide climate phenomena and their associated biases. Our objective is to dissect and locate the origins of bias within these simulations, thereby spearheading advancements and refinements in climate model development. The scope of our analyses includes a comprehensive review of the capabilities of the Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) in capturing the large-scale atmospheric circulation and weather patterns specific to Australia, categorised into ten distinct weather regimes. We delineated the principal factors that contribute to the variability observed in Australian rainfall patterns, as well as the primary sources of bias within the model.
