# Climate Conversations Archive
> This is an archive for the Climate Conversations Seminar series organised by researchers at the University of Queensland and Queensland Treasury. Archive is in the reverse chronological order. Talk abstracts and recordings can be found below where available.
> The seminar series is schedule to occur on the first Thursday of each month. Please contact the [seminar admin](mailto:sun.w.kim@uq.edu.au) to be added in the distribution list.

> **Deadlier natural disasters—a warning from Brazil's 2024 floods**
> Humans have dramatically altered the three pillars of natural disasters – hazard, vulnerability and exposure, as a result of global warming, landscape alterations and population growth, and increased the risk of destructive and deadly natural disasters. The seminar will present my recent perspective paper in Environmental Research Letter, where we breakdown how these factors played out to shape a perfect storm with unimagined consequences – the 2024 Brazil’s floods, one of the deadliest and most destructive recent natural disasters with over 180 fatalities. The event is used as a case study to illustrate how anthropogenic changes have altered the risk of deadlier natural disasters. We examine the extreme precipitation and the compounded climate extreme event, including its association with heatwave, atmospheric rivers from the Amazon and El Nino. We also assess changes in land cover, population and the impacts of the event. We discuss how this flood event is a heads up to global decision-makers that increases in hazard, vulnerability and exposure are changing the nature of natural disasters, making these destructive events the new norm. Extensive regions around the world are experiencing changes alike and may be challenged by similar circumstances in near future.

##### Ryan McGloin (Senior Climate Scientist, Climate Projections and Services, Queensland Treasury)
> The Queensland Future Climate Web Services have been designed to act as an essential resource for stakeholders to access data and information on plausible future climates across the state. Data on the web services are derived from dynamically downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and support stakeholders with climate risk assessments, adaptation planning and policy development using a variety of tools suited to meet different user needs. The recent enhancement of the web services includes the integration of the latest CMIP6 data into all the web services' tools. This addition underscores the state government's commitment to offering the latest information to stakeholders. In this talk, Dr. McGloin will outline the state government's objectives in providing these web services and their importance in state-wide climate initiatives. Dr. McGloin will also showcase features of the dashboard and demonstrate how the information on the dashboard can be leveraged.

> Understanding the intricate details of climate patterns is crucial for making informed decisions in climate change adaptation. Despite the remarkable advancements made in climate modelling over the years, persistent biases in model outputs continue to pose challenges, hampering both scientific understanding and the decision-making processes for stakeholders. This talk will focus on a critical examination of Australia's climate modelling simulations, particularly aimed at understanding the drivers of nation-wide climate phenomena and their associated biases. Our objective is to dissect and locate the origins of bias within these simulations, thereby spearheading advancements and refinements in climate model development. The scope of our analyses includes a comprehensive review of the capabilities of the Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) in capturing the large-scale atmospheric circulation and weather patterns specific to Australia, categorised into ten distinct weather regimes. We delineated the principal factors that contribute to the variability observed in Australian rainfall patterns, as well as the primary sources of bias within the model.
